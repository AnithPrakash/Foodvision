## Dataset and Model
An EfficientNetB3 model was employed for classifying food images. This model excels in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. A pre-existing dataset named "Food101" was utilized for training. While the model achieved an accuracy score exceeding 65%, it's crucial to acknowledge limitations. Food101 primarily focuses on food items commonly found in North America, potentially leading to a bias towards this region's cuisine. This bias might affect the model's ability to accurately classify food images from other parts of the world, particularly Europe.
